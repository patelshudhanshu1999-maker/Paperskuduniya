                  The Ghaggar River, known as the “River of Sorrow” due to frequent floods, is located in the Malwa region of Punjab, particularly affecting districts like Patiala, Sangrur, and Mansa. The river is seasonal and originates in the Shivalik foothills of Himachal Pradesh, flowing into Punjab near Dera Bassi, where its sudden surges during the monsoon can cause significant damage. Its unpredictable flooding, worsened by embankment issues and encroachments, has triggered disasters in 1988, 1993, 2008, 2019, and 2023.

                  Rapid warming of the Mediterranean has led to higher sea temperatures, attracting jellyfish and the Portuguese man o’ war—prey for blue dragons. As these food sources increase, blue dragons follow, disrupting marine ecosystems. Climate change underlies this rare phenomenon.

                  <b>Notes:</b>
                  The court determined that Trump’s invocation of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), 1977 to implement tariffs was incompatible with the intent of the law. IEEPA is traditionally used to address significant international threats, such as crises involving national security or foreign policy—not for economic trade imbalances. Previous presidents have used the act for events like the 1979 Iran hostage crisis or after the 9/11 attacks. The court clarified that IEEPA does not justify tariffs of unlimited scope, specifically in trade deficit contexts.

                 Indonesia suspended import of Indian groundnuts from 3 September 2025 due to Aflatoxin concerns. Suspension threatens new crop arrivals in a month, with groundnut sown on 48 lakh hectares this kharif season. Gujarat expects record 66 lakh tonnes, but prices remain below Minimum Support Price (MSP). Indonesia is India’s top buyer, importing one-third of exports — 2.77 lakh tonnes worth $280 million in 2024–25. Aflatoxins are toxic compounds from fungi Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus parasiticus, linked to liver cancer and health risks.
