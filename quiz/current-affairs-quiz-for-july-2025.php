                                groundbreaking effort to build human DNA from scratch. This project shifts from reading
                                DNA, like in the Human Genome Project, to writing and assembling it synthetically.
                                Scientists aim to create disease-resistant cells to repair damaged organs such as the
                                heart, liver, and immune system. It could help treat genetic and age-related diseases by
                                studying how genes control repair and development.<br>
                                Critics warn about ethical concerns like designer humans and synthetic life.
