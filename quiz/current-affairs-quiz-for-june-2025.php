                  <b>Notes:</b>
                  Recently, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) arrested alleged members of a transnational cybercrime syndicate under Operation Chakra-V. Operation Chakra-V aims to curb transnational organized cybercrime and digital arrests. Digital arrest is a scam where fraudsters impersonate law enforcement officials to extort money using threats like arrest, frozen bank accounts, and passport cancellations. To fight cybercrime, India has set up the Indian Cyber Crime Coordination Centre (I4C), Cyber Surakshit Bharat, Cyber Swachhta Kendra, and the Indian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-In). These initiatives work together to protect citizens and strengthen cybersecurity in the country.

                  The Perito Moreno Glacier, also called the ‘White Giant’, is located near El Calafate in Santa Cruz, Argentina. It lies in the Andes Mountains of South America and is part of the Los Glaciares National Park, a United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) World Heritage Site. The glacier was formed about 18,000 years ago during the last Ice Age. It is now rapidly crumbling due to global warming and rising temperatures.

                  <b>Notes:</b>
                  Recently, the Birch Glacier in Switzerland collapsed, causing a huge landslide that partly buried Blatten village. The landslide also affected the flow of the Lonza River, increasing local risk. Birch Glacier is located in the Lötschental valley in northern Switzerland. Experts say that climate change played a key role in this disaster. Switzerland, which has the most glaciers in Europe, has lost nearly 40% of its glacial volume since 2000. This incident highlights the urgent impact of global warming on mountain ecosystems.

It is designed for Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance (ISR) and precision strike missions. It is Turkey’s first armed UAV developed domestically, showcasing its defence manufacturing capabilities.

                  Recently, the central government revised the procedure for the Foreigners Identification Portal (FIP) under the National Automated Fingerprint Identification System (NAFIS). States and Union Territories have been directed to use fingerprint scanners available in districts through the District Police Module (DPM) of the Immigration Visa Foreigner Registration Tracking system (IVFRT). NAFIS is a pan-India searchable database that stores fingerprints related to crime and criminals. NAFIS is managed by the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) at the Central Fingerprint Bureau in New Delhi.

                  A special six-day “Bodhi Yatra” was organised in Uttar Pradesh from June 2 to June 7, 2025, to promote the state’s Buddhist heritage globally. The event was held under the Mekong-Ganga Cooperation (MGC) framework by the Uttar Pradesh Tourism Department and the Union Ministry of External Affairs. A 50-member delegation from five Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries—Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand, and Vietnam—joined the yatra. The tour covered key Buddhist sites like Shravasti, Kapilvastu, Kushinagar, Sarnath, and cities like Varanasi, Lucknow, and Agra.
