                  Recently, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) announced that its
                  Digital Payments Index (RBI-DPI) rose to 493.22 in March 2025.
                  This is a sharp increase from 465.33 recorded in September
                  2024, showing rapid growth in digital transactions. The
                  Digital Payments Index is a tool created by RBI to measure the
                  extent of digitisation of payments across India. It was first
                  launched in January 2021 to track and encourage the adoption
                  of digital payment systems. It is the first-of-its-kind index
                  to map the nationwide spread of digital transactions. The base
                  year for the index is March 2018, with the score for that year
                  set at 100.

On this day in 1839, the French government announced the invention of the daguerreotype, an early photographic process by Louis Daguerre. This invention made photography accessible and practical for people. The day raises awareness about photography’s role in storytelling, communication, and documentation. The 2025 theme is “My Favourite Photo.”

                  On 19 August 2025, Sundarbans in West Bengal became India’s second-biggest tiger reserve after the National Board of Wildlife (NBWL) approved its expansion. The reserve area increased by 1,044.68 sq km, taking the total to 3,629.57 sq km, just behind Andhra Pradesh’s Nagarjunasagar-Srisailam Tiger Reserve (3,727.82 sq km). Three tiger-inhabited ranges in South 24 Parganas — Matla, Raidighi, and Ramganga — were added. The expansion, cleared by the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) earlier, brings all tiger-bearing mangroves under unified management.

                  A Ukrainian drone attack recently caused a short-lived fire at the Kursk Nuclear Power Plant in Russia. Kursk region is located in the European part of Russia, bordering Ukraine to the west. It is historically famous for the Battle of Kursk in 1943, the largest tank battle in history and a turning point in World War II. The region lies within the basins of the Dnieper and Don rivers. Kursk hosts the Kursk Magnetic Anomaly, the world’s largest magnetic anomaly and one of the richest iron ore deposits. The incident raised concerns over nuclear safety in a strategically important region.
