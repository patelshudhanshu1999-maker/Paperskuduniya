                                A new analysis of NASA’s Cassini spacecraft data shows that Saturn’s moon Enceladus may support life. Cassini was a joint mission of NASA, European Space Agency (ESA), and Italian Space Agency (ASI). It was launched on October 15, 1997, to study Saturn and its moons in detail. The mission had NASA’s Cassini orbiter and ESA’s Huygens probe, which landed on Titan, Saturn’s largest moon. Cassini studied Saturn’s atmosphere, rings, and magnetosphere, along with Titan’s surface and atmosphere. It provided key insights into Saturn’s cloud properties, ring composition, and planetary evolution.

                                A recent expedition to Argentina’s Mar del Plata Canyon discovered over 40 possible new deep-sea species, including glass squids and pink lobsters. The Mar del Plata Canyon lies 250–300 km off Buenos Aires Province and is one of Argentina’s largest submarine canyons. It has fine sandy sediments mixed with terrigenous material and planktonic foraminifera. The region is highly productive due to the Argentine Shelf-break Front, where subantarctic waters meet the Falkland-Malvinas Current. A submarine canyon is a steep underwater valley cutting into continental slopes and shelves.

India’s total trade in Q4 reached $441 billion, up 2.2% year-on-year. Merchandise exports declined slightly due to mineral fuels and organic chemicals, while electrical machinery, pharmaceuticals, and cereals grew. North America was the top export market, growing 25%; UAE became India’s second-largest import source. The leather and footwear sector employs 4.4 million and contributes significantly to exports, with a 1.8% share in the $296 billion global market.

                                 In Punjab, incessant rainfall and floods stopped farmers from spraying anti-fungal medicines. This has led to the emergence of false smut disease, locally called haldi rog, in paddy crops. False smut is a major fungal disease of rice caused by Ustilaginoidea virens. The fungus attacks during the flowering stage, but symptoms appear after panicle emergence. Infected grains show black fungal growth, later covered with yellow fungal mass. It reduces seed germination and significantly lowers yield depending on infection level.
