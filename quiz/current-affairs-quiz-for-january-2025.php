                            LingoSat, a joint project of Japan’s Kyoto University and Sumitomo Forestry, is the first wooden satellite launched into orbit. It uses wood from honoki, a magnolia tree native to Japan, and is assembled using traditional Japanese crafts without screws or glue. The satellite’s name comes from the Latin word “Ligno,” meaning wood. LignoSat 1 is a CubeSat measuring 10 cm on each side and weighing 900 grams. LignoSat 2, a 2U CubeSat, is planned for launch in 2026.

                            Zoran Milanovic was re-elected as President of Croatia for a five-year term, securing 74% of the run-off vote. The first round of the presidential election on 29 December 2024 saw Milanovic win 49.1% of votes, necessitating a second round on 12 January 2025. Milanovic, backed by the opposition Social Democratic Party, is a critic of the EU and NATO but condemned Russia’s invasion of Ukraine while criticizing Western military support for Ukraine. The Croatian Democratic Union, the ruling party since 1991, had its candidate, Dragan Primorac, secure 19.2% of votes. The President in Croatia is the Head of State with limited executive powers, while the Prime Minister holds real executive authority. Croatia is located on the Balkan Peninsula along the Adriatic Sea.

India scores highly in the “Future of Work” indicator, trailing the US by less than a point. The country excels in readiness for digital roles alongside Mexico. However, India faces challenges in its higher education system, industry collaboration, and equipping graduates with in-demand skills. Despite strong GDP growth and a youthful population, India lags in sustainability and innovation metrics. To unlock potential, India needs better integration between education and industry.
