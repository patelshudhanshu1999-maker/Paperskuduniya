                            Andhra Pradesh launched the Thalliki Vandanam Scheme 2025 to support students from
                            financially unstable families. The scheme helps students from Class 1 to 12 continue their
                            education without financial worries. Eligible students who struggle to pay fees can apply
                            for assistance. The government aims to reduce dropout rates and ensure uninterrupted
                            education. The scheme reflects the state’s commitment to education accessibility and
                            financial support for underprivileged students.

                            Scientists have developed a new gene therapy for Maple Syrup Urine Disease (MSUD), a rare
                            genetic disorder. MSUD is caused by a deficiency of the enzyme complex needed to break down
                            branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) like leucine, isoleucine, and valine. It is inherited in
                            an autosomal recessive pattern, requiring both parents to pass on the gene mutation. The
                            disorder prevents proper amino acid metabolism, leading to neurological symptoms and
                            life-threatening brain damage.

                            Gujarat leads India in mangrove afforestation, covering 19,020 hectares in two years under
                            the MISHTI scheme. MISHTI (Mangrove Initiative for Shoreline Habitats and Tangible Incomes)
                            was launched in 2023 to expand mangrove forests and support coastal livelihoods. The
                            initiative aims to strengthen coastal ecosystems across India’s coastal states and union
                            territories. Gujarat’s rapid afforestation efforts have made it the top performer in the
                            scheme.
