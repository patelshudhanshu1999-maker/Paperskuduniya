                                    <p>The ongoing <a href="/previous-papers/ssc-cgl-previous-year-question-paper.php" title="Free SSC CGL Previous Year Question Papers with Answers">Staff Selection Commission (SSC)</a> Selection Post Phase 13 recruitment exam has triggered widespread protests across the country, with aspirants alleging mismanagement, repeated cancellations, and technical failures. The exams, which commenced on July 24 and are scheduled to conclude on August 1, have been marred by logistical and administrative lapses at several centres.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>The hashtag #SSCVendorFailure has been trending on X (formerly Twitter), with students demanding accountability from the SSC and the Ministry of Personnel. A “Delhi Chalo” protest has been called for July 31, with aggrieved candidates seeking an overhaul of exam management systems and a rollback of outsourced services.</p>

                                    <p>According to candidates, multiple exam shifts were either cancelled or halted abruptly. At Pawan Ganga Educational Centre 2, exams from July 24 to 26 were called off for “administrative reasons”. Similarly, the first shift at Educasa International, Hubbali, on July 24 was interrupted due to a technical glitch.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>While some of the cancelled shifts have been rescheduled from July 28 onwards, many aspirants said they received no timely communication and were left stranded after travelling long distances.</p>

                                    <p>Apart from technical snags, aspirants have also flagged poor infrastructure at exam centres. Complaints included malfunctioning systems, suffocating rooms without fans, broken chairs, and lack of basic amenities. Many candidates were assigned centres located 500–1,000 km away from their place of residence, adding to the financial burden.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>Criticism is being directed at the new private vendor engaged by SSC for managing exam logistics. Several users claimed that the vendor had previously been pulled up by a High Court in another case, raising questions over the selection process.</p>
