                                    <p>A government school building collapsed in Jhalawar, Rajasthan, on Friday morning, leaving at least four children dead and many others trapped. This tragic incident occurred around 8:30 am at Piplodi Government School in Manohar Thana. Approximately 40 children, teachers, and staff were present when the roof collapsed. According to sources, the school was in a dilapidated state, and several complaints had been filed, but no action was taken. The school offers education up to Standard 8.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>Jhalawar SP Amit Kumar confirmed that eight children have died and 17 others are injured. Ten children have been referred to Jhalawar hospital, with three or four reported to be in critical condition. Rescue operations are ongoing, with at least four JCB machines deployed to clear debris. Locals are also assisting to speed up rescue efforts. The Collector and disaster relief teams are overseeing the operations.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>Education Minister Madan Dilawar stated that he has directed district authorities to ensure proper treatment and relief. He assured a thorough probe into the matter and said critical children are being referred to Jhalawar, while others are being treated in Manohar Thana Hospital.</p>

                                    <p>According to a news report from the previous day, water in a school run by the Municipal Corporation of Delhi was so much that the teachers themselves had to take the nursery children to a safe place, he said.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>“Today, the news has come that the building of a school in Jodhpur has become so dilapidated that the children are forced to study under a neem tree,” he said.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>“The BJP, which boasts a lot about development, has ruined the country. Bridge collapses, train accidents, cracks in newly built roads, statues of great personalities getting damaged after inauguration — all these have become common,” he alleged.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>“The attention of the BJP is focused on only one thing - hunger for power!,” Mr. Kharge said.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>Former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi also lashed out at the BJP over the incident.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>“It is extremely saddening and worrying that several innocent children died and many others were injured when the roof of a government school collapsed in Jhalawar, Rajasthan,,” he said on X.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>“According to media reports, the government ignored the complaints about dilapidated schools, due to which these innocent children lost their lives. Most of these children belonged to the Bahujan Samaj - do their lives have no value for the BJP government?” Mr. Gandhi said.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>“There should be an impartial investigation of this incident and the culprits should be given the strictest punishment,” he asserted.</p>
